<h1>Neon Blaster VHDL</h1>

A VHDL project for playing Neon Blaster with FPGA on VGA monitor.

It uses two buttons on the FPGA board to move the player.

The bullets get shoot automatically and continuously in a specific period of time.

Enemies will come from the top of the screen in random speed and directions.

If the bullet hits the enemy, you get 1 point.

There are four 7 segments in FPGA board which represent a point screen (2 seven segments) and a timer (2 seven segments).

<h2>How you win?</h2>
Whenever the player gets 10 points, or it remains untouched by enemies, you win.

<h2>How You loose?</h2>
Whenever the player gets touched by enemies, you lose.

<h2>Project Details</h2>
This project is made in ISE Design Suite, and the hardware is Xilinx Spartan-6 xc6slx9 FPGA.
